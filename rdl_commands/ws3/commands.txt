# Student cannot copy paste commands from pdf so we made this file for them ; )

############# GLOBAL PLANNER

# [GP1]
roscore

# bringup robot, ros navigation stack (we use the costmap from them), and goal handler
# ---
# [GP2] use this command if you want to save computational effort in your machine
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation motion_planning.launch gazebo_gui:=false path_planning_srv_name:=/robot_design_lab/make_plan
# [GP3] use this command if your computer is awesome and you don't have problems wit graphics
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation motion_planning.launch gazebo_gui:=true path_planning_srv_name:=/robot_design_lab/make_plan

# [GP4] run path planning node
rosrun rdl_turtlebot3_navigation path_planning.py

# [GP5] open rviz to visualise the plan
rosrun rviz rviz --display-config `rospack find rdl_turtlebot3_navigation`/config/rdl_path_planning.rviz

# give a navigation goal in rviz to trigger global plan generation (2D Nav Goal)

############# DWA LOCAL PLANNER

# [DWA1] while its true that in every launch file comes with a roscore, this allows you to keep rviz open at all time
roscore

# bringup robot, ros navigation stack (we use the costmap from them), and goal handler
# ---
# [DWA2] use this command if you want to save computational effort in your machine
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation motion_planning.launch gazebo_gui:=false
# [DWA3] use this command if your computer is awesome and you don't have problems wit graphics
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation motion_planning.launch gazebo_gui:=true

# [DWA4] open rviz, debugging topic visualisation tool
rosrun rviz rviz --display-config `rospack find rdl_turtlebot3_navigation`/config/rdl_path_planning.rviz

# [DWA5] test your local planner implementation
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation dwa_motion_planning.launch

# wait but robot is not moving!!?
# give a navigation goal in rviz to trigger global plan generation (2D Nav Goal), see: https://youtu.be/GuYpWV9S65Y
