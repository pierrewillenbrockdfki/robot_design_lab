# Student cannot copy paste commands from pdf so we made this file for them ; )

############# GLOBAL PLANNER

# [GP1]
roscore

# [GP2] bring up robot (using gazebo backend only, no ui needed)
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_bringup_sim robot.launch gazebo_gui:=false x_pos:=0.0 y_pos:=-0.5 yaw:=1.57

# [GP3] run move base (ros navigation stack) for tb3 so costmaps become available
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation move_base.launch

# [GP4] run path planning node
rosrun rdl_turtlebot3_navigation path_planning.py

############# DWA LOCAL PLANNER

# [DWA1] while its true that in every launch file comes with a roscore, this allows you to keep rviz open at all time
roscore

# bringup robot, ros navigation stack (we use the costmap from them), and goal handler
# ---
# [DWA2] use this command if you want to save computational effort in your machine
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation local_planner.launch gazebo_gui:=false
# [DWA3] use this command if your computer is awesome and you don't have problems wit graphics
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation local_planner.launch gazebo_gui:=true

# [DWA4] open rviz, debugging topic visualisation tool
rosrun rviz rviz --display-config `rospack find rdl_turtlebot3_navigation`/config/rdl_path_planning.rviz

# [DWA5] test your local planner implementation
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation dwa_local_planner.launch

# wait but robot is not moving!!?
yeah.. publish a goal in rviz (watch: https://youtu.be/GuYpWV9S65Y)
