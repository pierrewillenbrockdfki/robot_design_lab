# [DWA2] use this command if you want to save computational effort in your machine
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation local_planner.launch gazebo_gui:=false
# [DWA3] use this command if your computer is awesome and you don't have problems wit graphics
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation local_planner.launch gazebo_gui:=true

# [DWA4] open rviz, debugging topic visualisation tool
rosrun rviz rviz --display-config `rospack find rdl_turtlebot3_navigation`/config/rdl_move_base.rviz

# [DWA5] test your local planner implementation
roslaunch rdl_turtlebot3_navigation dwa_local_planner.launch

# wait but robot is not moving!!?
