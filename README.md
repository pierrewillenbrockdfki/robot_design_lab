Robot Design Lab Uni Bremen lecture lab material will be placed here incrementaly as required.

## Hardware and software requirements

For the course exercises, we rely on a set of popular state of the art tools in robotics which in turn require some minimum software and hardware.

The recommended setup is a linux native installation with Ubuntu 18.04 preferably with a dedicated GPU because of the graphics rendering needs of the simulator however we provide a lightweight version as well that runs with no dedicated GPU.

The course software has proved to work on a PC with the following hardware: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz (No dedicated GPU). So we can safely assume that a PC with similar specs will be able to perform well.

We do not recommend nor give any technical support for the use of virtual machines as they have proven to have multiple problems in the combination with the simulator that we will use in the course (Gazebo 9), however, we do not claim that they will not work, so if you want to try you can do so, but bear in mind that depending on your PC manufacturer and VM settings it is very likely that your simulation will experience trouble.

In summary and very important: Please have ready for next week a system hardware-wise similar to:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz

Strongly recommended with a natively installed linux distribution (Ubuntu 18.04 preferred), such that it can support the installation of ROS1 melodic and Gazebo 9 simulator software.
